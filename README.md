# Caesar-Cipher
This is an enhanced version of the HackerRank python practice named "Caesar Cipher"

Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it using a cipher. Caesar's cipher shifts each letter by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y, and z would map to z, a, b and c.

But as this method of ciphering can be easily broken, I've added a feature named "add another language" where you can:

1.**Set your own letters pattern:** Like [z,d,l,k,g,t,e,q,u,o,f,s,p,a,y,h,j,u,b,...etc] to make it more difficult to be broken

2.**replace letters with symbols:** Like replacing "A" with "@", "C" with "(", "L" with "!", ...etc, so when you enter a word contains the replaced letter (A, C, L, ...etc) the word will contain shifted and un-shifted letters in the same word ðŸ˜‰
